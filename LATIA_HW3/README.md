[Website](https://knyliu.github.io/myweb/linebot_azure.html)

This project is about Natural Language Processing, and it utilizes a LINE chatbot as the platform for execution. The services included in this project are Sentiment Analysis, Information Extraction, and Text Summarization.

## Sentiment Analysis
There are three sentiment categories: positive, neutral, and negative. Along with each sentiment in the analysis results, a confidence score is displayed. Additionally, the subject associated with each sentiment is identified. This functionality could be particularly useful for segregating topics or for similar analytical purposes, depending on the subject matter.

## Extract Information & Summarize Text
With these features, users can easily obtain summaries of lengthy articles. The Information Extraction feature generates various types of nouns, including locations, dates, PersonTypes, skills, and more.

#### For Education:
Students can quickly grasp the main points of numerous essays. Additionally, if there is an internship hiring announcement, students can effortlessly gather all relevant information from the website, such as time, location, required skills, etc. Lastly, for responses to questionnaires, this tool can significantly aid students or teachers in efficiently reviewing all the feedback.
