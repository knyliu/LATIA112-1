# LATIA HW2 - Web Crawler

Education Data Web Crawler

Because of the large amount of data, I didn't set the number of pages I wanted to retrieve to the maximum possible. However, you can easily change this number in the code.

## Beautiful Soup

This is a project for learning about Large Language Models (LLMs). Based on the data we gather from websites using a Web Crawler, people can easily acquire knowledge about LLMs. The data we obtained from the HuggingFace website include open-source LLMs. Once you create a free API Key from HuggingFace, you can easily switch your model using the data collected through the Web Crawler. This data consists of the names of Large Language Models and the URLs to be used in the API. Additionally, it includes information on the number of downloads and likes.

## Selenium

This is a project for learning Python. I use Selenium, Beautiful Soup, and regular expressions to complete the project. Based on the data we gather from websites using a Web Crawler, people can easily learn about Large Language Models (LLMs). The data we obtained from the w3schools website consist of open-source teaching materials for Python. People can easily learn Python based on these organized files.

## Scrapy
This is a project for learning Python. I use Scrapy and regular expressions to complete the project.
